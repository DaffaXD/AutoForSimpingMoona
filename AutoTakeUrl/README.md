## REMINDER: YOU MUST DOWNLOAD / INSTALL THE IMPORTANT LIBRARY FROM THE ASSETS FOLDER BEFORE USING THE CODES 
if you have done that then goodluck

btw you must run the test_everything.py first before running test_output_url.py

and for reminder again, i wrote my code in macOs thats why there is a bit difference in the code so if you dont know the difference, ill help you with that

command is equal to control

macOs file path :
os.path.expanduser(~/your_folder/your_file)
example = os.path.expanduser(~/Documents/your_mom.png)

Windows file path :
C:\your_folder\your_file
example = C:\Users\Documents\your_dad.png

if you put the file in the same directory as the program, then you wouldn't have to do all of this bullsh.
