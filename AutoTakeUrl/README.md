## REMINDER: YOU MUST DOWNLOAD / INSTALL THE IMPORTANT LIBRARY FROM THE ASSETS FOLDER BEFORE USING THE CODES 
if you have done that then goodluck<br/>

btw you must run the test_everything.py first before running test_output_url.py<br/>

and for reminder again, i wrote my code in macOs thats why there is a bit difference in the code so if you dont know the difference, ill help you with that<br/>

command is equal to control<br/>

macOs file path :<br/>
os.path.expanduser( ~/your_folder/your_file)<br/>
example = os.path.expanduser( ~/Documents/your_mom.png)<br/>

Windows file path :<br/>
C:\your_folder\your_file<br/>
example = C:\Users\Documents\your_dad.png<br/>

if you put the file in the same directory as the program, then you wouldn't have to do all of this bullsh.<br/>
