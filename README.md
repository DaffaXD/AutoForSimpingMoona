### GitHub acc made for simping Hololive members and sharing my knowledge to other simping bros, or Trolling non simp with my EpIC skillZ
for simping only, if you are not a simp dont try this.

This is just a bored project, code may looks hacky thats why i need your help to improve my skill

Most of my automation codes needed a package thats why you need to install all of the package or Assets that is present on my codes.

I wrote it mostly in python, so you need a python compiler to run the codes.

That's it keep simping till you're winning.
